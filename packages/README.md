## Docspad

### This is an interactive coding environment. You can write Javascript, see it executed, and write comprehensive documentation using markdown.

- Click any text cell (including this one) to edit it

- The code in each code editor is all joined together into one file. If you define a variable in cell #1, you can refer to it in any following cell!

- You can show any React component, string, number, or anything else by calling the <b>show function.</b> This is a function built into this environment. Call show multiple times to show multiple values.

- Re-order or delete cells using the buttons on the top right.

- Add new cells by hovering on the divider between each cell

All of you changes get saved to the file you open Docspad with. So if you ran <b>npx docspad serve test.js</b>, all of the text and code you write will be saved to the <b>tes.js file</b>.
